 - [ ] Extract path expansion (~ and thisappdir)
 - [X] Add project config setting for vocab first run: additive (adds non-existing terms from term lists) vs. exact (also removes terms NOT in the shared term lists)
 - [X] Read project config / create Project class to orchestrate the rest
   - [X] .new(config)
   - [X] #instances
   - [X] #term_sources(Array[path])
   - [X] #version_log(path)
 - [X] Instance class
   - [X] create initial class
   - [X] gets password if needed
   - [X] creates connection
 - [X] TermSource
   - [X] determine type of self (:term_source or :authority)
   - [X] group on vocab (or auth type/subtype)
 - [-] AuthorityVocab - Behavior related to identifying current terms/delta for an authority vocab, etc
   - [X] identify current/first set of terms to load
   - [ ] identify delta between 2 versions
 - [-] TermListVocab - Behavior related to identifying current terms/delta for a term list vocab, etc
   - [X] identify current/first set of terms to load
   - [ ] identify delta between 2 versions
 - [-] VersionLog
   - [X] create class
   - [ ] create new file if path passed in intialize does not exist
   - [ ] #current_version(source, instance) ➡️ Integer (version number), nil (indicates first run)
   - [ ] #record_action(source, instance, version, date)
 - [ ] TermSourceJob
   - [ ] responsible for setting up/spinning off the jobs for individual vocabularies or authority vocabularies, collating responses, reporting any issues, and recording successful runs to VersionLog
   - [ ] .new(Instance, TermSource, VersionLog)
 - [ ] VocabSourceJob < TermSourceJob
   - [ ] check each vocab exists
   - [ ] spin off a VocabJob for each existing vocab
   - [ ] collates results (adds, deletes) returned from all VocabJobs
   - [ ] write terms to add to temp CSV in format for https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace_migration_tools/blob/term-manager/doc/add_vocabulary_terms.adoc
   - [ ] does term deletions
 - [ ] AuthoritySourceJob < TermSourceJob
 - [ ] VocabJob
   - [ ] .new(Instance, TermSource.delta, VersionLog)
   - [ ] pull existing terms
   - [ ] identify terms to add
   - [ ] if first run, and mode is exact, identify terms to delete
 - [ ] AuthorityJob
 - Later
   - [ ] Derive database login, use cache population instead of fully relying on API calls
