= Client config management

toc::[]

TIP: Do `thor list config` to see all config-related commands

== Active config
Whatever is in `./client_config.yml` is the instance any commands will be run against.

TIP:: Do `thor config:show` to show the active config

Because we typically need to work with multiple instances, we manage our client configs in the `./config` directory and use the `thor config:switch` command to control which is the active config.

WARNING: `./client_config.yml` and the contents of `./config` are excluded from version control tracking. **If you do anything to change the naming conventions or locations of these files make CERTAIN they do not get committed, as they contain sensitive information.**

TIP: Aside from the security concerns associated with deviating from the set conventions on config location/naming, none of the built-in config management stuff will work. *So, really just follow the pattern given.* ðŸ˜€

== Creating a new client config
For each CS instance you need to work with, you need to create a client config .yml file inside `./config`.

Copy `sample_client_config.yml` into `./config` with a name clearly identifying your instance (e.g. anthro_dev.yml, clientname_staging.yml, clientname_prod.yml) and edit it.

`sample_client_config.yml` is self-documenting.

If you want to start working with this config, run `thor config:switch clientname_staging`

== Updating a client config
IMPORTANT: Always edit the .yml files inside the `./config` directory.

If you updated the config that is currently active, run `thor config:switch active_config_name` to refresh the active config with the updated file.

The `config:switch` command doesn't know what the source of the current active config was, so it just re-copies whatever config you specify to `./client_config.yml` and reloads the app configuration based on the new copy.
